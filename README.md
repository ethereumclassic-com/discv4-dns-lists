# Ethereum Classic DNS discovery lists

Signed lists of Ethereum Classic and Mordor nodes, published in DNS so that
clients find their first peers through
[EIP-1459](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1459) discovery. The lists are
rebuilt every night from a crawl of the discv4 network, and every published list
is committed to this repository, so the record of what clients were given is
public. They are maintained in the
[`ethereumclassic`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic) organization by its core
developers and community contributors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Move to the community-maintained trees.** Core-geth `v1.12.x` finds its first
> peers through endpoints the ETC Cooperative maintained: DNS trees published from
> [`etclabscore/discv4-dns-lists`](https://github.com/etclabscore/discv4-dns-lists)
> and, in its later releases, the Cooperative's bootnodes. The Cooperative entered
> maintenance mode at the end of 2024, and its board has communicated that it will
> dissolve by the end of 2026 and that those trees will be archived as it does.
> The trees published here continue that service. Core-geth
> [`v1.13.x`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth/releases/latest), from
> [`ethereumclassic/core-geth`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/core-geth),
> reads them by default, and a `v1.12.x` node can switch with
> [one flag](#quick-start).
> [The ETC Cooperative transition](https://docs.coregeth.com/etc-cooperative-transition/)
> lists where the Cooperative's other services continue.

## The trees

```
enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.classic.ethereumclassic.net
enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.classic.ethclassic.net
enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.classic.ethereumclassic.network
enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.mordor.ethereumclassic.net
enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.mordor.ethclassic.net
enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.mordor.ethereumclassic.network
```

`all.classic.` is Ethereum Classic and `all.mordor.` is its Mordor test network.
All six are signed by one key, the text between `enrtree://` and `@`, and the
same URLs are compiled into core-geth. Each directory in this repository holds
one published tree and is named after the DNS name it serves.

## Quick start

**Core-geth `v1.13.x`:** nothing to configure. Both networks read these trees by
default.

**Core-geth `v1.12.x`:** add `--discovery.dns` with the three trees for your
network.

```sh
geth --classic --discovery.dns "enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.classic.ethereumclassic.net,enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.classic.ethclassic.net,enrtree://APDLRZ2T7ERXPWXX4D5USB32NIFYHXMFVZQ3DZALK6JJJ5L4VSYIQ@all.classic.ethereumclassic.network"
```

## Status

Every scheduled run reports its result on one issue labeled
[`pipeline-status`](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/discv4-dns-lists/issues?q=label%3Apipeline-status).
Subscribe to it to be notified when a run fails and when it recovers.

## Security

**To report a security issue privately**, email <security@ethereumclassic.net>.
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) has the details. Security issues are never reported
as public issues.

## Support this work

These trees are a public good. The
[Ethereum Classic DAO](https://ethereumclassicdao.org) is the legal entity that
maintains them, together with Ethereum Classic's core developers and community
contributors, and today it also pays for that work, as its funder of last resort.
The repositories stay in the `ethereumclassic` organization no matter who
maintains or funds them. Earlier, this work moved between ETCDEV, ETC Labs and
the ETC Cooperative as each one closed or left. With the ETC Cooperative's
dissolution, Ethereum Classic stakeholders such as mining pools, exchanges and
service providers should use <security@ethereumclassic.net> as their point of
contact.

If you are a stakeholder of Ethereum Classic, you rely on this infrastructure,
and Ethereum Classic has no protocol-layer funding mechanism for its critical
infrastructure or its core developers. Please consider sponsoring it.
[Support this work](docs/support.md) lists who has funded it, explains how
sponsors are credited, and gives the routes: an invoiced maintenance agreement for
organizations, or a direct transfer to an address provided on request.
